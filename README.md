# HCI-ML-with-Code
For me, HCI is a kind of technology driven design, which needs developers charge of both technology and design thinking. We can not ignore the fact that technology is the cornerstone in technology driven design, only when we have enough depth into technology field, we could then combine the design and technology together to create some slick products to amaze the world.

Deep learning is widely used in HCI field, it grants more power for designers and engineers to develop useful and friendly products for users. 
I reimplement some popular deep learing algorithms here for future using in my research.

深度学习是HCI领域的常用技术手段。我希望在这里复现并整理常用的深度学习模型，以备日后查阅。
