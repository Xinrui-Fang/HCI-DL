# HCI-ML-with-Code
Deep learning is widely used in HCI field, it grants more power for designers and engineers to develop useful and friendly products for users. 
I reimplement some popular deep learing algorithms here for future using in my research.

深度学习是HCI领域的常用技术手段。我希望在这里复现并整理常用的深度学习模型，以备日后查阅。
