# HCI-ML-with-Code
For me, HCI is a kind of technology driven design, which needs developers charge of both technology and design thinking. We can not ignore the fact that technology is the cornerstone in technology driven design, only when we have enough depth into technology field, we could then combine the design and technology together to create some slick products to amaze the world.

Deep learning is widely used in HCI field, it grants more power for designers and engineers to develop useful and friendly products for users. 
I reimplement some popular deep learing algorithms here for future using in my research.

对我来说，人机交互是技术驱动的设计，它需要研究人员同时掌握技术背景及设计思想。只有当研究者有深刻的技术背景，才有可能创作出一个有实际意义的，从零至一的产品，这也是人机交互的迷人之处。

深度学习是HCI领域的常用技术手段。我希望在这里复现并整理常用的深度学习模型，以备日后查阅，加油！
