# LSTM
This work follows from **[Time Series Prediction using LSTM with PyTorch in Python](https://stackabuse.com/time-series-prediction-using-lstm-with-pytorch-in-python/)**. The task is to predict flight travelling passengers. This is a good example for time series prediction with LSTM.  

## Dataset
Please install dataset with `pip install seaborn` or `conda install seaborn`, we use `flight` dataset in this library.

## Build and Run
The working file structure should look like this:
```
        [Layer 1]
        |---- LSTM.ipynb
```
