# Dataset 
* CIFAR-10
The image size of CIFAR-10 dataset is 32*32, which is too small for original ALexNet model, so I change the model of ALexNet to adapt for this dataset

# Environment && Dependency
* Windows 10
* Python 3.7
* Pytorch 1.2
* argparse

# Result
![train_loss](https://github.com/Xinrui-Fang/HCI-ML-with-Code/blob/master/Image%20Classification/AlexNet/img/train_loss.svg)
